## Selected Projects  

- **Skin Lesion Detection & Classification**
  - Developed a dual-stage deep learning pipeline: U-Net (VGG16 encoder) for lesion segmentation + Ensemble of EfficientNet-B0 and DenseNet-121 for classification.
  - Implemented attention mechanisms, focal loss, and adaptive mask generation to handle class imbalance and improve model robustness.
  - Achieved 96.2% accuracy, 95.8% precision, 94.7% recall, and AUC 0.982 on the ISIC2018 dataset (7 classes, 10,000+ images).
  - Developed Grad-CAM visualizations, ROC & PR curves for model interpretability.
  - Deployed as a full-stack web application: [https://skin-lesion-detection.netlify.app/](https://skin-lesion-detection.netlify.app/)  
- **Smart Traffic Prediction (LSTM)**
  - Developed a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict traffic flow patterns based on the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset.
  - Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and temporal pattern extraction to improve model accuracy and reduce prediction latency.
  - Trained and evaluated multiple models, comparing LSTM with GRU, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.037 and RÂ² of 0.94.
- **Facial Expression Recognition Using Hybrid CNN with Spatial Attention (BSc Thesis)**
  - Developed a hybrid deep learning model using a pre-trained EfficientNet backbone with Spatial Attention mechanisms for emotion-focused feature extraction (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise).
  - Fine-tuned on the FER-2013 dataset using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.
  - Extended the system for real-time facial emotion recognition through webcam input, with interactive responses triggered by the detected emotions.  
- **Cloud-Based AI Intrusion Detection System for IoT Networks** â€“ Implemented LSTM and Autoencoder models to detect anomalies in IoT network traffic using NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 datasets. The system achieved an F1 Macro Average of 93.97% and a Weighted F1 Score of 95%, demonstrating reliable detection and classification of network attacks.
