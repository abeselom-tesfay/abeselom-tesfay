## Selected Projects  

- **Skin Lesion Classification and Detection System** â€“ Designed a dual-stage deep learning pipeline for automated skin cancer diagnosis, integrating U-Net with a VGG16 encoder for lesion segmentation and an ensemble of EfficientNet and DenseNet for multi-class classification. Achieved 96.2% accuracy on the ISIC2018 dataset and deployed as a full-stack web app using Vue.js and Flask.  
- **Smart Traffic Prediction (LSTM)**
â€¢ Developed a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict traffic flow
patterns based on the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset.
â€¢ Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and temporal pattern extraction to improve model
accuracy and reduce prediction latency.
â€¢ Trained and evaluated multiple models, comparing LSTM with GRU, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving a
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.037 and RÂ² of 0.94.
- **Facial Expression Recognition (CNN)** â€“ Built a CNN-based emotion recognition system trained on the FER2013 dataset.  
- **Car Price Prediction System** â€“ Applied advanced regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) with detailed performance comparison metrics.  
- **Cloud-Based AI Intrusion Detection System for IoT Networks** â€“ Implemented LSTM and Autoencoder models to detect anomalies in IoT network traffic using NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 datasets. The system achieved an F1 Macro Average of 93.97% and a Weighted F1 Score of 95%, demonstrating reliable detection and classification of network attacks.
